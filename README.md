# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Diabetic Retinopathy Detection is a deep learning-based project designed to classify retinal images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy, including No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR. This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to analyze retinal fundus images and predict the severity of the condition. The application features a user-friendly Tkinter GUI, allowing users to upload images for real-time classification. The model is trained on preprocessed retinal images, ensuring accurate and efficient diagnosis. This system aims to assist medical professionals in early detection and diagnosis, potentially reducing vision loss caused by diabetic retinopathy. ðŸš€âœ¨
